            <h2>About</h2>
            <p>This is the main page for content on this site.
               The project is focused on implementing public APIs
               So that more interactivity can be implemented without
               having to hardcode all the values in a single or even multiple files.
               The two projects done on this site is the Dogs API which was created
               with the help of a tutorial created by Brad Schiff. A link to his tutorial
               can be found at the bottom of the page. The other webpage is based on this 
               tutorial, but will instead focus on gathering the stats of NBA players and 
               displaying them to the user.
